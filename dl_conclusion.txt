# Age Classification using Deep Learning Models

This notebook develops deep learning classifiers to categorize speakers from the BNC2014 corpus into age groups using:

1. **Binary Classification**:
   - **Young**: Speakers aged 0-29 years
   - **Old**: Speakers aged 30+ years

2. **Multi-Class Classification**:
   - **Young**: Speakers aged 0-29 years
   - **Middle-Age**: Speakers aged 30-59 years
   - **Senior**: Speakers aged 60+ years

We implement an RNN with attention mechanism, which unlike simple statistical models, can capture sequential patterns and contextual relationships in language.

## Approach

1. Load and preprocess the BNC2014 corpus data
2. Extract texts from speakers with known age information
3. Train RNN models with attention mechanisms for both classification tasks
4. Evaluate model performance using various metrics
5. Analyze the predictions and attention patterns
6. Compare performance against BERT and traditional machine learning methods

This analysis examines whether deep learning RNN models offer advantages over transformer-based methods (BERT) and traditional approaches for age classification based on linguistic patterns.

## Conclusion and Findings

In this notebook, we've implemented and evaluated deep learning models with attention mechanism for age group classification based on the BNC2014 corpus. We've created:

1. A binary classifier (Young vs. Old)
2. A multi-class classifier (Young vs. Middle-Age vs. Senior)

### Key observations from our analysis:

1. **Model Performance**:
   - The RNN with attention mechanism achieves competitive results compared to BERT models.
   - The bidirectional LSTM with attention allows the model to focus on specific words or phrases that are age-indicative.
   - The visualized attention weights provide insights into which parts of the text the model considers most important for classification.

2. **Comparison with Other Models**:
   - Traditional ML approaches like TF-IDF + Logistic Regression are faster to train but generally less accurate.
   - BERT models have more parameters and can capture deeper contextual relationships, but require more computational resources.
   - Our RNN model offers a good balance between performance and computational efficiency.

3. **Age Group Classification Patterns**:
   - The model identifies distinctive linguistic patterns between different age groups.
   - The attention mechanism highlights age-specific words and phrases.
   - Certain age groups are more easily distinguished than others.

4. **Practical Implications**:
   - The model could be used for demographic analysis in large-scale text analytics.
   - The attention mechanism provides interpretability, showing which parts of the text are most predictive.
   - The approach could be extended to other demographic attributes beyond age.

This work demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning models with attention for capturing subtle linguistic differences between age groups in natural language data.
